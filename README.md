SCRIP: Smart Currency Research+Implementation Project (or Smart Currency Realizing Its Potential)

Using rippled/XRP as the base software, I believe a currency can be generated with the purpose of enacting a real, tangible change in how we fulfill transactions in society. The goal with SCRIP is to develop a blockchain that is able to securely pair, verify, and confirm monetary holdings with personal, situational information for the purpose of facilitating conditional peer-to-peer transactions of any kind.
